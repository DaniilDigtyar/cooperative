Cooperator Increase Share Loan
------------------------------

This module extends cooperative management by allowing social capital
increases to be managed as permanent loans. When a cooperator makes a
capital increase, the module automatically creates a loan associated
with that increase.

Main features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Automatic loan creation when a capital increase is made
- The loan is generated when the increase invoice is paid
- Uses the same accounting account for the loan as used in the invoice
- Full integration between invoice and loan
- Tracking of increases and loans by cooperator
- Flexible configuration of interest rates and loan periodicity
- Automatic accounting management of generated loans

This module is designed for cooperatives that need to manage capital
increases as permanent loans, allowing for more efficient and automated
financial management of additional contributions from their cooperators.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

   - Minimum loan periods
   - Required accounts (short term, long term, interest expenses)

Creating Share Increase with Loan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Access Cooperatives > Cooperators menu
2. Select a cooperator
3. Create a new subscription request:

   - Type: Select "Increase"
   - Share Product: Select the configured share product
   - Number of shares to increase
   - The loan parameters will be automatically filled from the share
     product

Process Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Validate the subscription request

   - System creates an invoice for the share increase

2. Pay the invoice

   - When the invoice is paid, the system automatically:

     - Creates a permanent loan
     - Links the invoice with the loan
     - Sets up loan payment schedule

share product and the invoice. No additional configuration is needed
after the initial share product setup.
