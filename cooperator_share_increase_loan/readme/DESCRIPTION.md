## Cooperator Increase Share Loan

This module extends cooperative management by allowing social capital increases
to be managed as permanent loans. When a cooperator makes a capital increase,
the module automatically creates a loan associated with that increase.

### Main features:

- Automatic loan creation when a capital increase is made
- The loan is generated when the increase invoice is paid
- Uses the same accounting account for the loan as used in the invoice
- Full integration between invoice and loan
- Tracking of increases and loans by cooperator
- Flexible configuration of interest rates and loan periodicity
- Automatic accounting management of generated loans

This module is designed for cooperatives that need to manage capital
increases as permanent loans, allowing for more efficient and automated
financial management of additional contributions from their cooperators.
