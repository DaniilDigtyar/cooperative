## Cooperator Voluntary Contribution Loan

This module extends the cooperator management and voluntary contribution
functionalities in Odoo, allowing members to make additional voluntary
contributions to their share capital with the option of creating
associated loans.

### Key features:

- Registration of voluntary contributions from cooperators with loan
  creation.
- Integration of voluntary contributions with permanent loans.
- Customizable loan parameters for each voluntary contribution.
- Automatic creation and computation of loan lines upon validation.
- Tracking of contribution and loan history per cooperator.
- Integration with the accounting module for automatic transaction and
  loan recording.
- Flexible configuration of contribution limits, loan interest rates,
  and periodicity.

This module is ideal for cooperatives that want to offer their members
the option to make additional contributions in a flexible manner, while
also providing a mechanism for these contributions to be treated as
loans. It allows for more complex financial arrangements between the
cooperative and its members, enhancing the potential for capital growth
and member engagement.
